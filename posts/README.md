# 📝 Posts

This folder contains support materials, data files, and extras related to individual **Kowmang Toolbox Substack posts**.

Each subfolder is named using the format:

```text
YYYY-MM_slug-of-topic/
```

For example:

```text
2025-04_transit-tables/
```

## 📂 Inside Each Post Folder

Post folders are self-contained and may include:

- Markdown notes or summaries
- CSV files or datasets referenced in the article
- Archives or PDFs too large to embed directly
- Images, diagrams, or other visual aids
- A `post.link` file

## 🔗 `post.link` File Convention

Each folder contains a `post.link` file. This is a plain-text file with a single line: the URL of the original 'Kowmang Toolbox' Substack article that the folder relates to.

This allows easy navigation back to the associated article.

## 🧱 Formatting and File Conventions

- All `.csv` files use **semicolon (;)** as the field delimiter.
- All files use **UTF-8 encoding** and **LF (Unix-style) line endings**.
- Visual assets are stored in `.png`, `.svg`, or `.pdf` format depending on clarity and usage.

## 🔎 Navigating the Archive

Folders are organized chronologically by post date and topic. Each folder is self-contained. For a detailed description or purpose of the files, check for a local `README.md` or `summary_notes.md` file within the folder when available.

For general questions or feedback, visit the main repository or submit an issue on GitHub.

Stay useful. Stay curious.
